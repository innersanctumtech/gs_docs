    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: February 10, 2026</p>

    <p>Geometria Sacra ("the App") is developed by Inner Sanctum Tech. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>The App does not require user accounts, logins, or registration. We do not directly collect, store, or process any personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or location data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
    <p>The free version of the App displays banner advertisements provided by Google AdMob. Google's advertising SDK may collect certain information automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> (such as the Advertising Identifier / IDFA)</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising data</strong> (ads viewed, ad interactions)</li>
        <li><strong>Product interaction data</strong> (app launches, usage patterns)</li>
        <li><strong>Crash and diagnostic data</strong> (crash logs, performance metrics)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected by Google and is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. The data is not linked to your identity as the App has no user accounts.</p>

    <h2>App Tracking Transparency</h2>
    <p>On iOS 14.5 and later, the App requests your permission before allowing Google AdMob to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites. You may decline this request, and the App will continue to function normally with non-personalized ads.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The App offers a one-time in-app purchase to remove advertisements. This transaction is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not receive or store any payment information. Purchase records are managed by Apple and governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App stores minimal preferences locally on your device (such as language preference, playback position, and mute state) using standard iOS storage. This data never leaves your device and is deleted when you uninstall the App.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. The App's content rating is 4+ as it contains no objectionable material.</p>

    <h2>Ad-Free Experience</h2>
    <p>If you purchase the ad-free upgrade, Google AdMob is disabled entirely and no third-party data collection occurs through the App.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
